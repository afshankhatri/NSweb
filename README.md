# Nilax's Interactive Portfolio Website

A responsive, creative, and animated portfolio website built for a highly talented school-going teenager named Nilax — a multifaceted YouTuber, paleontologist, sculptor, writer, and academic achiever. Designed using React (JSX) and Tailwind CSS, the site is optimized for visual appeal, animation, and interactivity with a light-themed aesthetic and modular design system.

- ✨ Clean white spacing ensures high readability, minimal clutter, and user-first experience.
- 🎮 The site opens with a short (1-2s) animated intro, evoking the feel of a game/movie splash screen.
